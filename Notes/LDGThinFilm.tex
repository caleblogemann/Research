\textbf{\Large{Local Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the Thin Film Diffusion
Equation
}}
\end{center}

We would like to solve the 1D thin film diffusion equation with a Discontinuous Galerkin
Method.
The 1D diffusion equation is given as
\[
  q_t = -\p{q^3 q_{xxx}}_x.
\]

If we consider a single cell \(I_j\), do a linear transformation from
\(x \in \br{x_{j-1/2}, x_{j+1/2}}\) to \(\xi \in \br{-1, 1}\), and consider
specifically the Legendre polynomial basis \(\set{\phi^k(\xi)}\) with the
following orthogonality property
\[
  \frac{1}{2}\dintt{-1}{1}{\phi^j(\xi) \phi^k(\xi)}{\xi} = \delta_{jk}
\]
we can form a more concrete LDG method for implementing.
The linear transformation can be expressed as
\[
  x = \frac{\Delta x}{2} \xi + \frac{x_{j-1/2} + x_{j+1/2}}{2}
\]
or
\[
  \xi = \frac{2}{\Delta x} \p{x - \frac{x_{j-1/2} + x_{j+1/2}}{2}}
\]
After this tranformation the diffusion equation become
\[
  q_t = -\frac{16}{\Delta x^4} \p{q^3 q_{\xi\xi\xi}}_{\xi}
\]
on the cell \(I_j\).

We can then write this as the following system of first order equations.
\begin{align*}
  r &= \frac{2}{\Delta x} q_{\xi} \\
  s &= \frac{2}{\Delta x} r_{\xi} \\
  u &= \frac{2}{\Delta x} q^3 s_{\xi} \\
  q_t &= -\frac{2}{\Delta x} u_{xi}
\end{align*}
Now approximate \(r\), \(s\), \(u\), and \(q\) on \(I_j\) as
\begin{align*}
  r &\approx r_h = \sum{k = 1}{M}{R_k \phi^k(\xi)} \\
  s &\approx s_h = \sum{k = 1}{M}{S_k \phi^k(\xi)} \\
  u &\approx u_h = \sum{k = 1}{M}{U_k \phi^k(\xi)} \\
  q &\approx q_h = \sum{k = 1}{M}{Q_k \phi^k(\xi)}
\end{align*}

Plug into the equations and multiply by Legendre polynomials and integrate.
