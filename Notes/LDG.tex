\textbf{\Large{Local Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the Diffusion
Equation
}}
\end{center}

We would like to solve the 1D diffusion equation with a Discontinuous Galerkin
Method.
The 1D diffusion equation is given as
\[
  u_t = \kappa u_{xx}.
\]

If we were to naively apply DG methods, we could discretize the domain and
consider piecewise polynomial approximation.
We would then multiply by a test function and integrate by parts.
\begin{gather*}
  \dintt{I_j}{}{u_t v}{x} = \kappa \dintt{I_j}{}{u_{xx} v}{x} \\
  \dintt{I_j}{}{u_t v}{x} = \kappa \p{u^+_x v^+ - u^-_x v^-} - \kappa \dintt{I_j}{}{u_x v_x}{x} \\
  \dintt{I_j}{}{u_t v}{x} = \kappa \p{u^+_x v^+ - u^-_x v^-} - \kappa \p{u^+ v^+_x - u^- v^-_x}
    + \kappa \dintt{I_j}{}{u v_{xx}}{x}
\end{gather*}
This turns out to converge to the wrong solution.

The Local Discontinuous Galerkin method proposes a different approach.
First rewrite the diffusion equation as a system of first order equations.
\begin{align*}
  u_t &= \kappa q_x \\
  q &= u_x
\end{align*}
Now expand both $u$ and $q$ in the DG solution space, that is
\begin{align*}
  u_h &= \sum
  q_h &= 
\end{align*}
