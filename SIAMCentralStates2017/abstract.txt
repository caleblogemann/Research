Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for solving a Thin-Film Equation

The thin-film equation results from an asymptotic limit of the Navier-Stokes
equations and describes how a thin-film of fluid flows over a surface.
The thin-film equation contains both a convection and diffusion term and thus
is most often handled with operator splitting.
We describe how to use a an explicit Runge-Kutta DG method for solving the
convection equation and an implicit DG method for solving the diffusion equation.
To ensure fast convergence of the implicit method a multi-grid approach is used.
