Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for solving a Thin-Film Equation

The particular water-mass transport equation that we consider is the thin-film equation.
The thin-film equation results from an asymptotic limit of the Navier-Stokes
equations and describes how a thin-film of water flows over a surface.
The thin-film equation contains both a convection and diffusion term and thus
is most often handled with operator splitting.
We describe how to use an explicit Runge-Kutta DG method for solving the
convection equation and an implicit finite difference method for solving the diffusion equation.
