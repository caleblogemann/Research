In the space--time DG discretization no distinction is made between the space and time variables and discontinuous basis functions are used both in space and time. This approach results in an efficient numerical technique for physical applications which require moving and deforming elements, is suitable for hp-adaptation and results in a fully conservative discretization. A complete derivation of the space--time DG method for the advection--diffusion equation is given, together with the relation of the space--time discretization with the arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) approach. Detailed proofs of stability and error estimates are also provided. The space--time DG method is demonstrated with numerical experiments that agree well with the error analysis.},

In this paper, we extend the method to multidimensional nonlinear systems of conservation laws. The algorithms are described and discussed, including algorithm formulation and practical implementation issues such as the numerical fluxes, quadrature rules, degrees of freedom, and the slope limiters, both in the triangular and the rectangular element cases. Numerical experiments for two-dimensional Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics are presented that show the effect of the (formal) order of accuracy and the use of triangles or rectangles on the quality of the approximation.},
