\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
  In this work we have developed a discontinuous Galerkin method for solving a thin-film
  model.
  The nonlinear convection term, \(\p{q^2 - q^3}_x\), is discretized with the modal
  discontinuous Galerkin method and the nonlinear diffusion term,
  \(-\p{q^3 q_{xxx}}_x\), is discretized with the local discontinuous Galerkin method.
  The nonlinear diffusion is very stiff and would force a very tight time restriction,
  therefore implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods are used for solving the
  semi-discretized system.
  The implicit-explicit time-stepping allows for reasonable time steps to be taken given
  the stiffness of the problem.
  As the diffusion is nonlinear, this still requires solving a nonlinear system, however
  we are able to solve this nonlinear problem without a Newton iteration.
  In fact a Picard iteration was used, and it was demonstrated that only a minimal
  number of iterations were required to achieve high accuracy.
  Using this method we have demonstrated up to third order accuracy with the method of
  manufactured solutions.
  Only one iteration was required to achieve third order accuracy.
  Also we have showcased several numerical examples first given by Bertozzi.
  These examples show that our method preserves the nonlinear behavior of the Thin-Film
  model that was first shown in those examples.
