I present a discontinuous Galerkin method for the generalized shallow water equations
first introduced by Kowalski and Torrilhon.
These generalized shallow water equations introduce vertical moments into the shallow
flow's velocity profile.
As a result of these additional moments a nonconservative term appears in these
hyperbolic equations.
We use the Dal Maso, Le Floch, and Murat theory of nonlinear hyperbolic systems in
nonconservative form to correctly discretize this nonconservative term.
Using this theory a high order discontinuous Galerkin method is presented for the
generalized equations in two dimensions
