We present a discontinuous Galerkin method for the generalized shallow water equations first introduced by Kowalski and Torrilhon.
These generalized shallow water equations introduce vertical moments into the shallow flow's velocity profile.
As a result of these additional moments a nonconservative term appears in these hyperbolic equations.
We use the Dal Maso, Le Floch, and Murat theory of nonlinear hyperbolic systems in nonconservative form to correctly discretize this nonconservative term.
Using this theory a high order discontinuous Galerkin method is presented for the generalized equations on the sphere.
This work also updates some of the standard shallow water tests on the sphere for the generalized shallow water equations.
