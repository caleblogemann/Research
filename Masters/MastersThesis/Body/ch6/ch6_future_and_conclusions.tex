\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
This thesis has shown a discontinuous Galerkin method for solving a Thin-Film equation.

The implicit-explicit time-stepping allows for reasonable time steps to be taken given
the stiffness of the problem.
The nonlinear problem was able to be solved without a Newton iteration.
In fact a Picard Iteration was used, and it was demonstrated that only a minimal
number of iterations were required to achieve high accuracy.
We have demonstrated up to third order accuracy, and this was achieved with the number
of Picard iterations less than or equal to the order of accuracy.
