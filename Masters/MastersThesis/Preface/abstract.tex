This paper provides a high-order numerical scheme for solving Thin-Film models of the
form \(q_t + \p{q^2 - q^3}_x = -\p{q^3 q_{xxx}}_x\).
This numerical scheme is a discontinuous Galerkin method that builds upon the original
modal discontinuous Galerkin method as well as the local discontinuous Galerkin
method.
Propogation in time is done with an Implicit-Explicit Runge Kutta scheme, so as to
allow for larger time steps.
The timestep restriction for these methods is determined by the hyperbolic wavespeed
restriction, and is not limited by the diffusion term.
The resulting nonlinear equations are solved with a Newton-Free iteration.
In fact the nonlinear system is solved using a Picard Iteration, where very few
iterations are required for convergence.
